# clanky-game-engine
Simple 2D game engine (including a demo game) implemented using C++ and Qt. The project was created just for fun and to practise programming skills. 

The project includes ready-made game objects, and feature classes that can be (re)used to determine behavior of new objects. The project includes a demo game. In order to try the demo, you need to build and run the project.

To build this project you need Qt, which you can get here: https://www.qt.io/

The ClankyGameEngine project was tested on Windows 10 (version 1903) using Qt 5.12.5.
